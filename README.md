### 💡 Common Front Matter Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `title` | String | Page or game title |
| `subtitle` | String | Short descriptive phrase shown under the title |
| `status` | String | Used for status pill (e.g. `Active`, `Recruiting`, `Full`) |
| `system` | String | TTRPG system (e.g. `D&D 5e`, `Daggerheart`) |
| `schedule` | String | Game time or cadence |
| `players` | Integer | Number of players in the group |
| `thumb` | URL | Path to the hero thumbnail image |
| `resources` | List | Optional — appears only if present; used for download or external links |
| `short-description` | String | A concise teaser for use in grids or cards |

These variables are referenced throughout the templates using standard Liquid tags,  
and unused fields gracefully fail (for example, `resources` only displays if defined).
