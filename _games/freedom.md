> Beneath the dying sun of Athas, life is worth less than water.

> Chains fall. Blood spills. And for the first time in your life, the air tastes like freedom.

**What to Expect**
- Oppression, rebellion, and survival against impossible odds
- Harsh environments and limited resources
- High stakes roleplay and psionics-tinged action
- A story that can end in triumph, tragedy, or both

**Player Guidance**
- You start the story in chains — but who you become after that is up to you.
- Create a character grounded in survival, endurance, and adaptability.
- Avoid divine classes; there are no gods on Athas.
- Psionics and moral complexity fit this world best.
